# Assignment 1 - Use a REST API

In this assigment, we will be connecting to an open REST API and displaying data on a web page that is returned from an API.

## Steps

1. Select an open (no authentication required) API. - A few of my favorites are the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/) and the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)
2. Create a website. - Don't do this from scratch. Use bootstrap or something like it.
3. Connect the website to the API and display data from the API.
4. Add interactivity. (3 items) - Things like click for more information, and search are good ways to allow user interactivity.
