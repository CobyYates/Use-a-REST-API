# Assignment 1 - Use a REST API

In this assignment, we will be creating a simple webpage/web app that will display data returned from an open web API.

## Steps

1. Select an open (no authentication required) API. - A few of my favorites are the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/) and the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)
2. Create a website.
3. Connect the website to the API and display data from the API.
4. Add interactivity. (3 items) - Things like click for more information, and search are good ways to allow user interactivity.

Interactivity (3 items, must pull more data) | 

## Helpful Hints
- The interactivity can be simple. Things like pagination (a next button), or view more detail, work great!
- Keep the HTML website simple, use a html framework and/or template. This is about using javascript to **fetch** (cough.. Cough.. hint..) data.
- When using Github, be sure to clone the repo from Github using the `git clone` command.
- If you don't already have SSH Keys set up for github, I would HIGHLY recomend setting those up. [Click here for Github Help](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
- Don't be worried about writing "dirty" code. The idea here is to have a working prototype. I am not expecting production ready code.
